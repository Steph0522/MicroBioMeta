The goal of `MicroBioMeta` is to analyze, visualize, and explore data from microbiome studies of amplicon and metagenomic sequencing at taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic levels.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `MicroBioMeta` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("MicroBioMeta")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Steph0522/MicroBioMeta) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("Steph0522/MicroBioMeta")
```
